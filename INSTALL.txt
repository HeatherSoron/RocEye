Dependencies: Ogre, OIS, CMake

Note: due to lack of support for recent versions of OS X, OIS will be replaced with another library very soon.

Windows:
========
Build instructions will come as soon as I prep binaries for the non-programmers in our group.


Linux:
======
1. Install Ogre 1.7.2+ (may have to build from source) and CMake.

2. Navigate to this directory and run the following commands:

cmake source/
make

3. Run the RocEye binary.


Mac OS X:
=========
Erm... this could take a bit. It's tricky. Ogre might be hard to build, and OIS does *not* work on Lion. Give us a bit of time to figure this out (since we DO have Mac users in our group!).
