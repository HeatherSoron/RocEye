Dependencies: Ogre, SDL, CMake

Windows:
========
Build instructions will come as soon as I prep binaries for the non-programmers in our group.


Linux:
======
1. Install Ogre 1.7.2+ (may have to build from source) and CMake. Libraries should be installed in /usr/local/lib/OGRE or /usr/lib/OGRE.

2. Navigate to the main RocEye directory and run the following commands:

cmake source/
make

3. Run the RocEye binary.


Mac OS X:
=========
Erm... this could take a bit. It's tricky. Ogre is apparently hard to build, and the Macports version may or may not work. Give us a bit of time to figure this out (since we DO have Mac users in our group!).
